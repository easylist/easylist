     Having multiple people adding their opinion doesn't help, and may result in ticket being locked.
     Removal / Change of filter will be up to the filter list author.
     There will be no guarantee that any filter will be removed, but it'll be stated in comments.

     Ticket maybe closed/locked if:
        (a) Abusive chat (GH / Twitter /FB etc)
        (b) Disagreements leading to an impass. 
        
     Timeframe of any fix will depend on each ticket.
