Today we reached a milestone of 200,000 commits.

From the Easylist authors to the adblocking community, 
           To all the list authors, 
           contributors, 
           community/forum moderators,
           extension authors,
           the companies and organisations that support,
           users of adblocking software,
           we say THANK YOU.

To the ad and tracking companies, that keep us busy trying with new ads and trackers, we also say THANK YOU. 

We will continue to innovate and improve the blocking and deliver the best user experience people demand.
