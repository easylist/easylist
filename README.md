These lists are maintained by Fanboy, MonztA, and Khrin.

## EasyList

The goal of this repository is to block ads on English and International sites. By blocking the following:
 - Ad scripts (Generic and site-specific)
 - Cosmetic filtering (Generic and site-specific css)
 - Ad servers (Block servers that host ads/ad-related contents)
 - Prevent popups/popunders (Block scripts or domains that cause popups/popunders/ad notifications)

Anti-adblock in Easylist will cover cosmetic and generic blocks checks:
 - Prevent adblock users showing a website
 - Create elements to disrupt viewing a website

For legal reasons, Anti-adblock this will only cover:
 - Adult websites
 - File or Link hosting/sharing
 - Streaming/Torrent/Comic sites
 - Any historical anti-adblock rules

## EasyPrivacy

The goal of this repository is to block tracking and improve end user privacy. By blocking the following:
 - Analytics
 - Bot checks
 - Telemetry
 - Tracking cookies
 - Pixels
 - Referrers
 - Beacons
 - Fingerprinting
 - Impressions/Event/Perf/Pageview logging
 - User agent monitoring
 - Resource Miners
 - Hit Counters
 - CNAME trackers
 - Linking to other 3rd-party tracking servers
 - Some unnecessary 3rd-party scripts/images
 
When a site is attempting to track, it'll be put into one of 4 categories.
 - Generic blocks (common url/tracking filter patterns) used by 1st/3rd-parties.
 - 1st-party tracking. Self hosted trackers and CNAME trackers.
 - 3rd-party tracking. Hosted by another provider, which hosts a tracking script, but not actually a tracking company.
 - Tracking-servers. Where the server has only one purpose to track/analyze user, will be blocked at the url level.
